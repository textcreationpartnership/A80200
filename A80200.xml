            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Honourable and truly Religious Lady, JANE Counteſſe <hi>Dowager</hi> of <hi>Marr,</hi> Encreaſe of Grace and Peace.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE certain knowledge I have had for a long time of your devout affection toward the ſaving Truths of Jeſus Chriſt, the recent ſenſe of manifold favours received at your hands, both ſince and in the time I had the honour of employment for many years in that Noble Family, and the experience of your gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of my hearty endeavours unto your ſervice, makes me bold to offer to your Ladiſhip this part of my weak Labour, as a ſmall Teſtimony of my humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of much duty.</p>
            <p>I do here preſent you with ſome refreſhing drops from that Myſtery of <hi>Contentment</hi> found in the <hi>Fulneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> In him is enough to ſupply all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the inward man, and more then enough to ſupply all wants in the outward man which can befall us, from the diſappointing and diſcontenting changes in perſons or things of this world: yea, it is of the Lords wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:167969:3"/>and mercy that our waies are hedged up with thorns, that we may return to our firſt love, <hi>Hoſ. 2.6, 7.</hi> That we may delight our ſelves in him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that ſolid, ſatisfactory, and unchangeable Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in experience we perceive cannot be found in the empty, inſufficient, uncertain and periſhing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the poor creatures. Many times the Children of God enjoy moſt of himſelf when they enjoy leaſt of the Creature. As the Sufferings of Chriſt abounded in <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo Conſolation alſo abounded by Chriſt, <hi>2 Cor. 1.5.</hi> He had most of Gods preſence when he had leaſt of mans countenance, <hi>2</hi> Tim. <hi>4.16, 17, Stephens</hi> face ſhined like an Angels when men looked on him like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, <hi>Act. 6.15.</hi> Such enjoyments at ſuch a time are no other (as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid from his experience of light ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of darkneſſe) then the gate of heaven, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude on earth of that immediate Contentment we ſhall have in heaven in God alone, without either oppoſition or interpoſition of the Creature. Hence it is that the Children of God from the comfortable ſenſe of this love have moſt vigour of grace ſometimes under greateſt outward preſſures, they can <hi>glory in tribulations,</hi> Rom. <hi>5.3.</hi> And <hi>ſing praiſes to God in a priſon,</hi> Act. <hi>16.26.</hi> Then have they enlarged ſpirits when their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are under reſtraint: As the Sunne re-enforceth his light in the time of an Eclipſe, ſo the graces of the Spirit in the inward man are the more united and ſtrengthened in an hour of darkneſſe from outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: The heat of our love as the Sunne-beam from the hard rock, is the more reflexed toward the Sunne of righteouſneſſe from the cold and hard re-encounters of the Creatures.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:167969:3"/>
            <p>In a day of proſperity our affections lagge and ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle here and there, ſeeking Contentment in things farre below our happineſse, and no waies proportionable to the vaſt deſires of the ſpirit of man; Therefore our God in great wiſedome and mercy ſo orders the removall of worldly objects, that our affections may be retired, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, and with greater vigour ſet upon himſelf, that according to our meaſure of enlargement of heart, our meaſure of delight and contentment in Chriſt may be the greater, he dryeth up the brinks to the end we may ſeek and be filled with purer and ſweeter contentment in the Fountain: This earneſt and firſt-fruits of abſolute and full ſatisfaction abiding them in heaven, makes the Children of God humble in their greateſt proſperity, and patient with much contentment in their greateſt adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: Faith looks to things not ſeen; It reckons all worldly advantages but loſſe and dung in compariſon of the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and alſo reckons that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with that glory which ſhall be revealed in us. A look to things not ſeen preſerves the ſoul from fainting at what we ſee or feel: And though the Children of God be ſubject to ſome qualms of fear in time of ſtorms and trials, yet all theſe will be gone as a ſea-ſickneſse when our Lord ſhall bring us within the port of eternal ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> You know both whom and what ye have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved: As it's his will ye ſhould look to the glory ſet before you, and endure the Croſſe; So that ye ſhould alſo rejoyce in the hope of that Kingdom which cannot be ſhaken, that eternal manſion above all poſsibility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, and that Inheritance incorruptible which cannot be
<pb facs="tcp:167969:4"/>defiled, and fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for you, by his Interceſsion who purchaſed it by his merit. That your Ladiſhip may be comforted, guided, and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his Spirit in this life; and brought into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of that full happineſſe in the other life, is and ſhall be the humble prayer of him who in all duty is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſhew himſelf, <hi>Madam,</hi>

               <note place="margin">The myſtery of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is taught only in the School of Chriſt. It is not taught from principles of nature.</note> 
               <hi>is taught only in the School of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> The truth of this Doctrine will appear if we conſider 1. how it is not taught, 2. how it is taught.</p>
            <p>It is not taught from any principles of corrupt nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this being alike in all the children of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in its operations, and ſo all men ſhould be taught this contentment, but the contrary is ſeen in many male-contents and murmurers under their preſent condition in the world: Corrupt nature frets at every thing diſpleaſing to fleſh and bloud, until it be healed by the grace of regeneration; But where this ſecret fretting is, there can be no true content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be taught by the moral precept of Natural men: It is true, heathen men,
<note place="margin">Nor by morall precepts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men.</note> ſpecially the <hi>Stoick Philoſophers</hi> have ſpoken ſomewhat to this purpoſe, yet they did not teach men to be content in whatſoever eſtate; They did commend that horrid ſinne of ſelf-murther in the caſe of diſ-content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; They compared mans life to a banquet, that he might willingly leave when once he were full, and to a ſtage-play that he might leave when once he were wearied; And <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:167969:18"/>cals ſuch a death a gate to liberty; This is not to teach contentment in every eſtate; As they failed fouly in their precepts, ſo in their practiſe of contentment; It is true, ſome heathens appeared content in their ſober and courſe diet of living: <hi>Fabricius</hi> that Noble Romane Senator was content to feed upon his diſh of Roots, and he anſwered to theſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, who would have corrupted him with vaſt Sums of gold to betray his own Countrey, that a man who was content to feed on Roots needed not their gold: yet they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in every eſtate; they could not endure diſgrace in the world, for their honour was their Idol; <hi>Lucretia</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica</hi> could not bear their diſgrace with any contentment, but made away themſelves in their violent fits of diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:

            <p>Next the truth of this Doctrine appeareth,
<note place="margin">It is taught 1. By the Word</note> if we conſider poſitively how this myſtery of contentment is taught; It is taught in the School of Chriſt. 1. By the Word of God. 2. By the example of Chriſt. 3. By the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>

In thy bodily wants learn contentment from him; when he was hungry and none miniſtred unto him; The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil tempted him to diſcontent and murmuring, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.3. <hi>If thou be the Son of God, command that theſe ſtones be made bread;</hi> Our Lord anſwered, <hi>It is written, man ſhould not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God;</hi> He that at firſt by his powerful word gave life to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can, if it ſo pleaſe him, by that word preſerve life; When ſuch means fail, yet learn from thy Lord to ſubmit to the will of God, and to truſt in his power that is not limited to ordinary means; In his thirſt they gave him gall; whereas others at their death got wine to make them forget their pain, yet he was content, he did not complain of them to God, but in great calmneſſe of ſpirit and eminency of love praied to the Father for them, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing;</hi> He renders wine for their gall: yea, though all thy life time thou ſhouldſt live in poverty, yet look to Chriſt and be content, for he was poor in his

When thou art traduced by malicious detracters, be patient and content; look to thy Lord who was without all ſpot and blame, and yet was traduced, as a man glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and a wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and ſinners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.19. a deceiver of the people, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.63 and a complier with that <hi>arch malignant ſpirit, Mat.</hi> 12.24. The Servant ſhould be content when he is no worſe, yea, not ſo evil entreated as his Lord and Maſter; when thou art affronted and mocked to thy face by inſolent enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting on thy miſery, be content and look to thy Lord who was <hi>as a ſheep dumb before her ſhearer,</hi> he was affronted with a Scepter of reed put into his hand, with a tormenting crown of thorns on his head; they mocked him by bowing the knee, wagging the head; and upbraided him with cruell mockings, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.5. when thou ſuffereſt injury in thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at the hands of cruell and inſolent men, yet be content and ſubmit to the will of God, who takes off the collar of reſtraint from their tongues and hands; Look to thy Lord blinde-folded, ſpitted on, buffeted, ſcourged, and crucified between two theeves; <hi>If they do theſe things in a green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry?

            <p n="1">1. What is meant by this ſtrength.</p>

Luk. 9.73. <hi>They were all amazed at the mighty power of God;</hi> by which he ſubdued all things, and will raiſe the dead. <hi>Phi.</hi> 3.21, <hi>Who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able to ſubdue all things.</hi> This ſtrength is eſſential to the Sonne of God, and incommunicable to the creatures; <hi>the mighty one of Iſrael</hi> puts forth this ſtrength toward the defence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:167969:24"/>of his own children in time of danger, but puts it not in them; as a ſtrong man will uſe his ſtrength for the defence of them that are weak, but puts not his ſtrength within them: But by ſtrength is here meant <hi>an ability created and infuſed into the heart of a beleever, whereby he is enabled in ſuch perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as is accepted of God in Chriſt, for doing and ſuffering the will of God:</hi> It is a ſtrength from Chriſt in them, as the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal imports, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> it is a ſtrength in the innerman, but from his Spirit. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16. <hi>ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit.</hi>

            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Why it is called the ſtrength of Chriſt.</note> It is called the ſtrength of Chriſt: 1. <hi>Becauſe Chriſt hath procured this ſtrength to us by his merit and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</hi> Joh. 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another comforter,</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>Becauſe Chriſt is the efficient cauſe, and worker of this ſtrength in us.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord who hath enabled me;</hi> it is the ſame word which is uſed here; 2 Tim. 2.1. <hi>Be ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> or <hi>by Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the Prepoſition is frequently uſed; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. it is rendred by the Heaven. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.20, 21, 22. where it is five times ſo uſed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.21.

            <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. How a man by the ſtrength of Chriſt is able to do all things.</note> As to the third thing to be cleared, How a man is able through the ſtrength of Chriſt to do all things, thoſe of the <hi>Romane Church</hi> underſtand it thus; That a renewed man by the grace and ſtrength he receives from Chriſt, is able to keep the whole Law perfectly and abſolutely in all points and degrees of legal perfection: to this purpoſe is that peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory aſſertion of the <hi>Council of Trent. Seſſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Gan.</hi> 18. But the Scripture tells us, it was Gods purpoſe to ſave man, not by his own inherent righteouſneſſe though wrought in him by Chriſt, but by the righteouſneſſe of a Mediator. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:167969:24"/>5.31. <hi>He hath made him to be ſinne for us who knew no ſinne, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him:</hi> If it were poſſible for a renewed man to keep the Law, then might he be juſtified and ſaved by the Law; but no man is juſtified by the Law. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38. <hi>Be it known unto you, that thorow this man is preached unto you forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and by him all that beleeve are juſtified from all things from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> Gal. 2.21. <hi>If righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be by the Law, then Chriſt hath died in vain.</hi> But in a ſound ſenſe the words may be taken three wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By way of reſtriction</hi> to the particulars ſpoken of <hi>ver.</hi> 11,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 12. I can do all theſe things, to wit, I can abound, I can be abaſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet be content.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> all the good things I am able to do, I can do them by Chriſt who ſtrengtheneth me. The like phraſe we have, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Chriſt enlightneth every man that cometh into the world;</hi> that is, every one that is enlightned, is enlightned by him; for there be many that never were enlightned with that ſpeciall illumination of faith: So it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. <hi>God is the Saviour of all men, ſpecially of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> that is, all men who are ſaved and preſerved, either by a generall providence from temporall miſery, or beleevers that are ſaved in a ſpeciall manner by a Mediator from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall miſery, they are all ſaved by God; and in another ſenſe it cannot be underſtood: for many are not preſerved from bodily and temporall evils, and farre more are not ſaved and preſerved from eternall miſery; for the ſpeciall ſalvation is only of beleevers, and all men have not faith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A man renewed is able to do all things <hi>in a righteouſneſſe and perfection Evangelical,</hi> ſo far forth as God pardons his ſinnes, accepts in <hi>Chriſt</hi> his weak endeavours, and covers the imperfections of his beſt performances with the perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo he walks anſwerable to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:167969:25"/>that requires truth and ſincerity in our obedience, he is able through grace to walk without offence in his outward converſation; in his purpoſe of heart he is <hi>willing to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,</hi> Heb. 13.18. and endeavours <hi>to keep a conſcience void of offence toward God and man,</hi> Acts 24.16. But to do all things in a legal perfection he cannot, becauſe ſuch a perfection is only to be ſought in Chriſt the mediator, who was made of God unto us righteouſneſſe in the Covenant of Grace.</p>

            <p>As the ſtrength of a beleever for doing is from Chriſt, ſo alſo for ſuffering and for bearing every burden God in his good providence layes on him; Our ſtrength to ſtand out againſt the violence of temptations from within us, is all from Chriſt. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. The Lord ſaid unto me (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in the day of temptation) <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſſe;</hi> as the ſtrength of the foundation is made manifeſt by ſupporting all the ſtones built upon it; ſo the ſtrength of Chriſt is declared to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtrength in upholding all the living ſtones built upon him; though the tempeſtuous windes of temptation may

Is not the work of our Sanctification perfected at our death?
<note place="margin">What is meant by good work.</note> how then is it ſaid, God will perform it until the day of Chriſt? <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer to the firſt; by good work is meant <hi>a communion with Chriſt in the graces of his ſpirit,</hi> wrought in us by the Spirit and word of promiſe; Of this good work the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaketh in this Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Goſpel.

<note place="margin">What is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by perſevering in grace.</note> 2. How perſeverance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing to come, is ſaid to be certain. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer to the firſt; the word <hi>grace</hi> is taken ordinarily <hi>for Gods free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> for that giving grace, from which, as the fountain, doth flow, through the merit of our mediatour, all ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: It is ſo taken Eph. 2.8. <hi>by grace are ye ſaved,</hi> Rom. 3.24. <hi>being juſtified freelie by his grace.</hi> It is alſo taken for the <hi>grace that is given,</hi> which doth flow from the fountain of free grace and love. Ioh. 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace:</hi> Such graces are faith, hope,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:167969:38"/>Love, and other ſaving Graces of the Spirit; There is a perſeverance <hi>actual</hi> in the exerciſe and actings of holy duties: <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>They continued ſtedfaſtly in the Doctrine of the Apoſtles.</hi> And there is (to ſpeak ſo) an <hi>effectual perſeverance</hi> in reſpect of a ſettled inclination and diſpoſition to holy duties, though there may be ſome remitting in, or intermitting of the acts and exerciſe thereof; ſuch is our perſeverance in prayer. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Praying alwaies,</hi> as a Muſical inſtrument well tuned by the hand of the skilful Muſitian, though it be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes plaid on, and giving out a ſound, yet it is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">How perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in grace is ſaid to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> A thing to come is ſaid to be certain two wayes. 1. <hi>In reſpect of Gods Decree,</hi> and this is the certainty of <hi>Immutability,</hi> becauſe Gods Decree, counſel and purpoſe is unchangeable. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. Thus it was <hi>certain</hi> that our Lord ſhould be delivered unto death, becauſe it was ſo <hi>determined</hi> in the eternal counſel of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Him being delivered by the determinate counſel and foreknowledge of God.</hi> 2.

Thus it was certain that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould betray our Lord, becauſe our God in his permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Decree foreſeeing it would be, revealed the ſame in his Word; the perſeverance of renewed men is certain in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; firſt in reſpect of Gods Decree. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39. Next in reſpect alſo of Gods revealed Will, concerning their perſeverance. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.28. <hi>I give unto my ſheep eternal life,</hi> and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the Fathers will, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould looſe nothing.</hi>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:167969:47"/>as a word for avowing his Lord and Maſter:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the voice of a ſilly Damſel dampts his Spirit. 2. In reſpect <hi>of cheerfulneſs in time of doing duties;</hi> at one time it will be their meat and drink to do the will of their heavenly Father, they will have alſo much contentment in ſerving their Lord, as hungrie and thirſtie men have in eating and drinking at another time holy duties will be a burden to them: <hi>David</hi> with a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart danced before the Ark, but great fear ſurpriſed him when he ſaw <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi> ſmitten, this made him change his note: we can look cheerful in a day of proſperity, rejoycing in our Lords preſence, but in our adverſity we queſtion the Lords preſence, and ſay with <hi>Gideon, Iudg.</hi> 6.13. <hi>If the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us:</hi> we can at a time when God reveals himſelf to us in ſome ſpecial teſtimony of his love, with <hi>Peter</hi> in the Mount, exult at a glance of his glory; but at the time of our Lords ſuffering in his Myſtical body, our hearts become drouſie and careleſs, as <hi>Peters</hi> was in the Garden. 3. In reſpect <hi>of the degree and meaſure of Faith;</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> at one time the renewed children of God will be like a Ship with all her ſailes full, they will have a plerophorie of Faith; at another time like a Ship in a great ſtorm, with a peice of croſs ſail, their Faith is but little and weak under ſome great tryal; ye ſee it in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 27.10. <hi>When my Father and my Mother did forſake me, then the Lord did take me up:</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.2. <hi>We will not fear though the earth be removed:</hi> there was great Faith, but ye ſee a ſlacking of his Faith. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.22. <hi>I ſaid in my haſt, I am cut off from before thine eyes.</hi> and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> In reſpect <hi>of their continuance in duties;</hi> at one time the children of God will continue in ſome benſal of Spirit with delight in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret devotion; at another time they have not well begun, but they become weary, their untimous and impertinent thoughts puls them away to ſome other buſineſs; It is thus alſo in their hearing, reading, and meditation on the good word of God; at one time they will continue in hearing with much reverence and attention, though the Miniſter be a

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Spiritual pride and vain confidence in our own ſtrength for the imploying and improving of any Grace or Gift received of God, brings with it a decay of the vigor of Grace;</hi> as the ſwelling bigneſs of the Spleen makes the other noble parts of the body to decay, ſo the ſwelling pride of our Spirit makes the Graces of the innerman to abate of their ſtrength; Pride goeth before a fall: It is ever followed in the children of God with a fall, either into ſome croſs, or into ſome ſin to humble them: <hi>Ezekias</hi> was lifted up in the pride of his heart, and therefore was wrath threatned againſt him and all <hi>Judah.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 32.25. <hi>Peter</hi> in the pride and preſumption of his own ſtrength boaſted, though all the world ſhould be offended, yet ſhould not he be offended in Chriſt; whereupon followed a great abatement of the ſtrength of Grace, when he denyed the Lord of Life. 3. <hi>Sloathfulneſs in not improving the ſtock of Grace, or Gifts God hath beſtowed upon thee, brings on a decay.</hi> Strong bodies through lazineſs and want of exerciſe, become weak and feeble; It is no wonder the Merchant becomes poor, who improves not his little ſtock to ſome advantage; and it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:167969:48"/>is no wonder a Chriſtian decay in the meaſure of grace, if he improve not his talent to the glory of his Lord, to the good example of his neighbor, and to his own comfort in laying up a ſure foundation againſt the time to come,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that he may lay hold on eternal life. 4. <hi>When our eye and heart is too much fixed on viſible and ſenſible objects of ſorrow or fear, then our graces begin to abate ſomewhat of their former vigour;</hi> great and long troubles oft-times weaken our Faith: when <hi>Peter</hi> looked too much to the wind that was againſt him, and not to the Lord who called him to come on the waters, his Faith began to fail, and his body that before was elevated by a believing ſoul, did now begin to ſink, weak Faith made a heavy body.</p>
            <p>As to the third, how to prevent this decay of Grace, it is evident by knowing and ſhunning the evils that procure it;
<note place="margin">Means to prevent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in grace.</note> Therefore 1. make conſcience to uſe the means whereby grace is begun, preſerved, and encreaſed in the ſoul: as faith comes by hearing the word of God,

            <p>Firſt <hi>God diſſerts wicked men out of wrath,</hi> as a Judge,
<note place="margin">Diſſertions are either, 1. Penal.</note> to puniſh them for their antecedent and wilful diſſerting of him and his holy commandments; for this end God never doth diſſert a juſtified and regenerate perſon: becauſe wrath was taken away in his Juſtification, at which time God accepted him in the beloved: God never hateth thoſe he once Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in Jeſus Chriſt: as he ever loveth his Son, ſo he ever loveth all the Myſtical Members of his Son: as he loveth the head ſo the Members alſo: But God as a Judge, in wrath doth diſſert wicked and unrenewed men to correct them and to manifeſt his Juſtice againſt, and hatred of them: This he doth, not by withdrawing ſaving or renewing grace from them, for ſuch they never had: but by withdrawing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reſtraining grace, which formerly was as a ſtrong ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant to keep their wickedneſs from overflowing: Such was that Penal and Judicial diſſertion of the Jews. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.42. <hi>God turned, and gave them up to worſhip the Hoſt of heaven:</hi> ſuch was that diſſertion of the <hi>Romans.

               <hi>God diſſerts ſometimes his own children in an hour of temptation, as a Father diſpleaſed with them, by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrength, and his upholding Grace, to the end he may chaſtiſe and humble them for ſome corruption not perceived, or not mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for by themſelves:</hi> to this end the Lord diſſerted <hi>Peter,</hi> and did not ſtrengthen him by a ſpecial help of grace in that hour of temptation in the High Prieſts hall, that he might chaſtiſe and humble him for ſelf-confidence, whereof <hi>Peter</hi> took no notice before his fall.

            <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. Probato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> 
               <hi>Sometimes the Lord diſſerts his own children in reſpect of ſenſe of any preſent comforts, to this end, that he may try the Faith and patience of his own children,</hi> who in the cloudy and dark day muſt walk by Faith and not by ſenſe: This may be called a diſſertion Probatory: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Now for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ye are in heavineſs through manifold temptations, that the tryal of your Faith being much more precious then of Gold, may be found unto praiſe,</hi> &amp;c.

<note place="margin">The manner of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting.</note> 
               <hi>It is not in reſpect of his love toward them:</hi> This is founded on his eternal purpoſe of electing them in Chriſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and it is unchangeable: yea it is out of love he chaſtiſeth them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6.10.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and alſo <hi>for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holyneſs;</hi> Neither is it a diſſertion <hi>in reſpect of the life of grace,</hi> for even when the children of God fail, and do not act grace, yet the ſeed remains in them, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Peter</hi> fell
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:167969:50"/>foully, yet at that time the Lord preſerved the life of Faith in his ſoul. <hi>Luc</hi> 22.32. <hi>Sathan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as Wheat, but I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not;</hi> as God preſerved life in <hi>Eutychus,</hi> notwithſtanding his ſore fall. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.10. So the Lord preſerveth the life of Faith in the hearts of his renewed children in the time of their great and foul falls; No thanks to them, but all praiſe to God, who forſaketh not the work of his own hands in them: But God diſſerts his own children ſometime in <hi>reſpect of ſtrength, when he upholdeth them not in the hour of temptation,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but leaveth them to themſelves, and to the ſtrength of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; Thus God diſſerted <hi>David</hi> in the matter of <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheboh</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> as alſo <hi>Peter</hi> when he denyed the Lord: Sometime he diſſerts his own children in <hi>reſpect of comfort,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
               <hi>when he hideth the light of his countenance,</hi> when he with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or with-draweth the joy of his Spirit: Thus was <hi>Iob, David,</hi> and our Lord himſelf diſſerted, when he cryed out on the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> This diſſertion of our Lord was no waies in reſpect of the love of the Father for he was ever his well beloved: Neither was it in reſpect of ſtrength to ſuſtain him under the burden, for he was ſuſtained by the Divine nature dwelling in him bodily: It is true, diſſertion in reſpect of ſtrength hath ever with it a diſſertion alſo in reſpect of comfort: for then the children of God, being without ſtrength, do ſuccumb to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore become heartleſs and comfortleſs, like weak men robbed of their treaſure of peace and joy: yet there may be a diſſertion in reſpect of comfort, when in the mean time they are not diſſerted, but upholden by a ſecret ſtrength: as a perſon fainting and ſinking down, may be upholden by one at his right hand, though in the time he have no ſenſe of it: ſo many times the dear children of God are upholden by the ſtrength of God, that they deſpair not in their greateſt troubles, when in the mean time they have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,

            <p>Conſider the meaſure of diſſertion: <hi>the children of God are not in a like meaſure diſſerted at all times:</hi> ſometimes more,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:167969:51"/>ſometimes leſs, at one time they are ſhaken with the wind of temptation, as a tender plant, but not caſt down, at another time they are laid on the ground, brought under the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like a young tree born down with a great ſtorm, yet are never plucked up by the root, becauſe they are ingrafted in Chriſt, and that root of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> beareth them: at a time they will be diſſerted in reſpect of ſtrength, for doing and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome one gracious act, and yet at the ſame time they will be eminently aſſiſted of God in the exerciſe of another grace. <hi>Peters</hi> zeal to be at Chriſt was very great, when he deſired to come through the deep Sea to him. <hi>Math.</hi> 14. But his faith was weak, when he ſaw the wind boyſterous: The children of God will have ſtrong deſires after God, and yet at the ſame time much weakneſs of Spirit, and remiſſneſs in their ſpiritual courage: ſuch was <hi>Davids</hi> diſpoſition. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.1. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God:</hi> yet at the ſame time his heart was much diſcouraged and diſquieted with the reproaches of enemies: They will alſo be fervent in Prayer and yet at the ſame time not ſo patient, as at other times: Thus was it with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 31.22. <hi>I ſaid in my haſt, I am cut off from before thine eyes:</hi> there is a fit of weakneſs and impatience, and yet at the ſame time he is fervent in prayer: <hi>Thou heardeſt my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, when I cryed unto thee:</hi> as of ſome ſeeds ſown in one ſeed-plat, ſome herbs may appear ſooner, and be higher then others: and the ſame which were at one time high, may take a ſetting, and be overtopped by others: ſo in a renewed man when he is regenerate, the ſeeds of all the ſaving graces of the Spirit are planted within his heart, but ſometime the fruit of one grace, and ſometime of another will be more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, according to the wiſe and gracious diſpenſation of God, out-letting on, or reſtraining the influence of his Spirit from the ſeeds and habits of grace received.</p>
            <p>Laſtly conſider thy duty in a time of diſſertion,
<note place="margin">The duty of a renewed perſon in the time of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</note> when the Lord hideth his face from thee: 1. <hi>Search thy wayes,</hi> for as under a diſſertion thou doeſt obſerve a change in Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and diſpenſation toward thy ſelf, ſo if thou ſearch diligently and impartially,

It is alſo our Chriſtian wiſdom care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to obſerve the time when God hides his countenance, and it is our duty to ſearch our waies: if we light the candle of our conſcience from the light of Gods Word, as the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in the Goſpel did, to ſearch after, and to find the loſt pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, we ſhall undoubtedly find, that ſince the time we had the comfort of Gods preſence, we have departed from his wayes and turned from him, it may be by our ingratitude, and not rendering to him according to the favours received, or by our ſpiritual pride and vain gloriation, as if we had not received it of free love, by our bitterneſs of Spirit, and repining at afflictions, by our indignation at others, becauſe more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the world then our ſelves: by neglects or omiſſions of duties, by a negligent and overly performance of them; or by ſome lurking corruption not perceived and mourned for by us. 2.

It is with men depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, as with thoſe that ſail away from the firm Land, they think as they remove from the Land, ſo it removes from them; but when they turn ſail, they find the Harbour in the ſame place they left it: ſo when we turn from God, we do think in the ſenſe of our bad deſervings, that the Lord is turned from us, but when we change our courſe, and turn

<note place="margin">Sin brings death.</note> when it came into the world, and was taſtened in our nature by a virtual conſent in our firſt parents, it brought death along with it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21. <hi>By man came death:</hi> By death, the wages of ſin, we underſtand both all the alterations in the body preceding our death, and alſo all the pains and evils that accompany death; Thus then by death we underſtand thoſe particular evils of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. 1.

            <p>Firſt man by ſinning <hi>became ſubject to a neceſsity of dying:</hi>

<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pelagius</hi> confuted.</note> To affirm that Infants were not born in ſin, but that they had it only by imitation; when he was preſſed by force of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from the death of Infants as a bitter fruit of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal corruption in them, his anſwer was, that man would have dyed, though he had never ſinned, becauſe (ſaid he) man had a mortal body compoſed of contrary elementary qualities, which warring one againſt another, would have made alteration in the body, and in the end brought it to corruption and diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:167969:56"/>But for confutation of this error, we ſhould conſider, Firſt as God created <hi>Adam</hi> with power of free will to ſtand or fall,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſo he created him with a capacity to dye or not dye, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the right uſe or abuſe of his free will.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next, as God did not create <hi>Adam</hi> with an inclination (though he was of a mutable condition) to ſin; for as an inclination to ſin, being the firſt ſtep of turning from God, is ſinful, and the moſt holy God is not the Author of ſin; ſo a ſubjection to the neceſſity of dying was not, before man ſubjected himſelf willingly to ſin; for our moſt juſt God, though by an act of ſoveraign power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over his own creature, <hi>as the Potter over his veſſel,</hi> he might annihilate the ſame, yet would he not puniſh his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent creature before it had ſinned, and was found guilty, and lyable to puniſhment. This was <hi>Abrahams</hi> argument for ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the innocent in <hi>Sodom,</hi> if there were any; <hi>Shall not</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the Iudge of all the earth do right? Gen.</hi> 18.25.) As for the contrary Elementary qualities of heat, and cold, moyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dryneſs created in the body; I anſwer, if man had perſiſted in his integrity, keeping an harmony with God and his will, then God would have kept theſe qualities in a right tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and juſt ſymmetry amongſt themſelves, without deſtroying one another: As by an over-ruling providence he preſerved the Lyon and the Lamb, the Woolf and the Kid together in one Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> without the deſtruction of the Lamb and Kid; as he reſtrained the Lyon from deſtroying the living Aſs, or the dead body of the Prophet, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. As he reſtrained the fire <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. in the exerciſe of it, that it did not ſo much as ſinge a hair of their heads, though at the ſame time he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the fire in the heat and nature of it; So the Lord would have preſerved thoſe elementary qualities in their nature and firſt act, though in their ſecond act and exerciſe he would have reſtrained them from deſtroying one another, if man had ſtood in integrity: And will not the Lord preſerve our glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in heaven in a condition of an immutable immortality and incorruption, though they will be raiſed (as is very probable) with the ſame Elementary qualities wherewith they were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the ſtate of integrity?
<note place="margin">2. Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſickneſs.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly as ſin brought on man a neceſſary ſubjection to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:167969:56"/>death and diſſolution, ſo it <hi>brought alterations upon the body by weakneſs and ſickneſs:</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> acknowledged in the time he was under ſome diſtemper in body. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.3. <hi>there is no reſt in my bones becauſe of my ſin;</hi> weakneſs and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the body is a conſequent of ſin; if man had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the ſtate of innocency, his labour &amp; exerciſe in the body ſhould have been to him as a recreation with delight, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtrength in his Spirit, whereas it is ſince the fall with toyl in the body and faintneſs in the Spirit. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat thy bread.</hi> Mans fainting and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs of Spirit in the labour of his calling do convince him guilty of original corruption, and preach unto him humiliation and repentance; as wearineſs, ſo ſickneſs in the body, is a fruit of ſin; It is a commotion and colliſion of thoſe humors in the body, which God reſtrained from breaking out one upon another, ſo long as man by ſin tranſgreſſed not the bounds ſet to him by God; but when man paſſed his bounds, then the humors of the body paſſed their bounds, and like an impetuous flood after the bulwark is removed, over-runs the whole body: Sin made way to this inundation, which in the eſtate of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was barred up in the body by the over-ruling providence of God, who ſhutteth up and openeth the barrs even of the great ocean at his own pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Thirdly from ſin <hi>is that tormenting fear of death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fear of death.</note> which keepeth the heart of miſerable man in ſtraitneſs and bondage. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Through the fear of death all their life time are ſubject to bondage:</hi> In which words a ſinner is compared to a Malefactor condemned, ſhut up in priſon, and under a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fear of the execution of the ſentence: It is the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> alluſion alſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Scripture hath ſhut up all under ſin;</hi> that is, it hath convinced all men of guiltineſs and of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to eternal death. <hi>Iob</hi> 18.14. Death is called <hi>the King of terrors;</hi> Heathens called it the moſt fearful of all fearful things: <hi>Caligula</hi> the fourth <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, hid himſelf under a bed when he heard the noiſe of thunder; guiltineſs in the conſcience, is the worm that breeds this gnawing and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting fear of death. <hi>Cains</hi> guiltineſs made him fear every one that met him, would kill him: This fear of death until it be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:167969:57"/>qualified and tempered by Faith in the Merit of the death of our Lord, doth exceedingly torment and diſquiet the heart of man; in the midſt of all his pleaſures even a glancing thought of death maketh his heart ſorrowful; Amidſt all his plenty he is like unto <hi>Damocles,</hi> who had not a heart to taſte the dainties on <hi>Dionyſius</hi> his table, for fear of the drawn ſword hanging over his head by an hair; in like manner the fear of death in his adverſity doth wonderfully diſquiet him; he taketh a very ſmall croſs, though it were but a ſore head, to be a beginning of his endleſs woes, to be a drop of that cloud of fierce wrath that is to be poured out upon him in vials at his death and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be a Meſſenger ſent of God to arreſt him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4. Pain in dying.</note> 
               <hi>Pain in dying</hi> is alſo a bitter fruit of ſin; This bitterneſs and <hi>Antipathy</hi> betwixt the living man and death is a part of the wages of original ſin; It is true ſome wicked men may have little or no pain at their death. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.4. <hi>There are no bands in their death.</hi> But all that calmeneſs is but a ſhore Sun-ſhine before a ſtorm: the fearful tempeſt of Gods wrath abideth them; their day comes on apace, wherein their worm dyeth not, and their fire will not be quenched: The rich Glutton (no doubt) at his death had ſtore of all Lenitives that could give him any eaſe, whereas <hi>Lazarus</hi> had none. But that rich man afterward felt the pain to the uttermoſt; he got not <hi>a drop of cold water to refreſh him:</hi> The death of ſome wicked men is like thoſe <hi>Fiſhes</hi> going down with much facility through <hi>Jordan,</hi> till they once fall into the dead Sea, and there they die; ſo <hi>the wicked man is driven away in his wickedneſs, but the righteous hath hope in his death.</hi> Prov. 14.32.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">5. Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> In the firſt death is implyed <hi>the diſſolution it ſelf, when the ſoul and body by their union making up one perſon, are ſeparated the one from the other;</hi> This actual ſeparation is alſo a puniſhment of ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> It is true <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were born in ſin, but had not this ſeparation of ſoul and body; yet it is certain, when they were tranſlated in the body to heaven, they were ſeparate from the ſociety of men living on the earth: they were changed from a ſtate of corruption, which was a ſeparation, not of the ſoul from the body, but of all corruption from the body, and of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:167969:57"/>remainders of ſin dwelling in both: Moreover God who is above all his penal Laws and Statutes, might according to his good pleaſure give an Indulgence and Immunity to his ſervants from that penal Ordinance of death, as he did grant unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> an Indulgence to eat of the Shew-bread, notwithſtanding there was a poſitive Statute to the contrary.</p>
